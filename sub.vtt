[distorted] Adams! Come on.
What the hell? Why'd you stop?

02:43.877 --> 02:46.171

04:59.887 --> 05:02.807
Take your puny haul
and multiply it by five.

- How?
<i>- While you were scrounging around</i>

If anything happens,

just ask them to use their phone

- Yeah, spill it, Keith.

07:53.019 --> 07:57.315
You want information,
then I need something in return.

07:59.942 --> 08:03.362
No, no, no. No way.
You're not getting a date with her.

08:03.446 --> 08:05.031
Mike, come on. Just get him the date.

08:05.114 --> 08:06.866
I'm not prostituting my sister!

08:06.949 --> 08:09.535
- But it's for a good cause.
- No, don't get him the date. Know what?

08:09.619 --> 08:12.455
He's gonna spread his nasty-ass rash
to your whole family.

08:12.538 --> 08:15.958
Acne isn't a rash and it isn't contagious,
you prepubescent wastoid.

08:16.042 --> 08:19.170
Oh, I'm a wastoid?
She wouldn't go on a date with you.

Let's take that top score back, huh?

09:53.222 --> 09:54.307
[Murray] Good morning, Jim.

09:55.766 --> 09:59.645
- Jim. Hold on a second. We need to talk.
- Get away from me.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.939
Okay, no... I think you really
wanna hear this.

10:02.023 --> 10:05.234
- Get away from me.
- Trust me. I only want five minutes!

10:05.318 --> 10:08.821
Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek.
We all want things.

10:08.904 --> 10:10.656
This isn't a laughing matter, Jim.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.283
- This is serious, okay?
- [groans]

10:12.366 --> 10:14.285
I really got something here.
I'm telling you!

10:14.368 --> 10:15.703
- Hey. Mornin', Chief.
- Morning.

10:15.786 --> 10:16.871
Morning, Murray.

10:16.954 --> 10:19.498
Got any proof
on your butt-probin' aliens yet, Murray?

10:19.582 --> 10:22.918
- [Powell laughs]
- I believe there was, and may still be,

10:23.002 --> 10:24.837
a Russian spy presence in Hawkins.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.380
Russian spies!

10:26.464 --> 10:32.053
Are the spies in cahoots with the aliens?
Or how do they fit in here? I'm confused.

10:32.136 --> 10:34.930
I'm talking multiple reports now.
Multiple reports, okay?

10:35.014 --> 10:36.515
Of a Russian child in Hawkins.

10:36.599 --> 10:40.686
- A child? What are you talking about?
- A girl who may have psionic abilities.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.188
- "Psionic"?
- Psychic.

10:42.271 --> 10:44.357
What about that girl
that made that kid pee himself?

10:44.440 --> 10:45.316
- A prank.
- What girl?

10:45.399 --> 10:46.692
- Wasn't a prank.
- [Hopper mocks]

10:46.776 --> 10:48.653
You got five minutes. Not a second more.

10:49.737 --> 10:51.739
[Murray]
I talked to a Big Buy ex-employee

10:51.822 --> 10:55.618
who said some little girl
shattered the door with her mind.

10:55.701 --> 10:56.577
I heard that story.

10:56.661 --> 10:59.789
Did you hear the one about the fat man
with the beard who climbs down chimneys?

10:59.872 --> 11:02.375
[Murray] Then last month,
a co-worker of Ted Wheeler's claims

11:02.458 --> 11:05.920
some Russian girl with a shaved head
was hiding in his basement.

11:06.003 --> 11:07.254
Ted now denies this.

11:07.338 --> 11:09.882
- Oh, wow. That's a surprise.
- But it connects.

11:09.965 --> 11:11.384
- Enlighten me.
- This girl,

11:11.467 --> 11:14.053
she's some kind
of a Russian weapon, right?

11:14.136 --> 11:16.180
Barbara sees this girl,
tries to help her, perhaps.

11:16.263 --> 11:19.141
But before she can,
the Russians find them, take them--

11:19.225 --> 11:23.270
Wait. You're telling me Barbara Holland
was kidnapped by Russian spies.

11:23.354 --> 11:25.898
- Kidnapped. Killed.
- Killed?

11:25.981 --> 11:27.400
- Don't you get it, Jim?
- No.

11:27.483 --> 11:30.528
This has potentially
international implications.

11:30.611 --> 11:34.156
I'm talking a full-on Russian invasion
right here in Hawkins.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.034
[whirring]

11:37.118 --> 11:40.329
Do you have any proof of this girl?
I mean, has anybody seen her recently?

11:40.413 --> 11:41.539
- These are separate--
- [phone rings]

11:41.622 --> 11:42.832
Excuse me. Sorry.

11:42.915 --> 11:44.041
- Okay.
- Hello?

11:44.125 --> 11:46.752
Merrill called,
wants you to check out his pumpkins.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.296
<i>- Says they've been contaminated...</i>
- All right.

11:49.380 --> 11:53.008
...by his vengeful neighbor, Eugene.
You're welcome.

11:54.009 --> 11:56.095
I'm sorry. I really hate to do this,
but I gotta run.

11:56.178 --> 11:58.556
- It's an emergency.
- You gave me five minutes.

11:58.639 --> 12:01.267
Yeah, listen, you know what?
I liked your alien theory a lot better.

12:01.350 --> 12:02.935
And you want my advice?

12:03.018 --> 12:06.105
Why don't you stop bleeding
those people dry and go home? All right?

12:06.188 --> 12:09.108
- I am not bleeding anyone... dry.
- Listen to me. Go home.

12:19.285 --> 12:20.744
It's crap, I know.

12:22.163 --> 12:23.372
No, it's not crap.

12:25.124 --> 12:27.418
- It's not good.
- It's going to be.

12:27.501 --> 12:31.255
- Just... It needs some reorganizing.
- [sighs]

12:31.338 --> 12:33.174
- Can I mark on it?
- Yeah, I guess.

12:33.257 --> 12:34.884
So, in the first paragraph,

12:34.967 --> 12:37.970
you used the basketball game
versus Northern

12:38.053 --> 12:40.681
as a metaphor for your life,
which is great.

12:40.764 --> 12:43.309
But then, around here,

12:43.392 --> 12:46.437
you start talking about your granddad's
experiences in the war.

12:47.438 --> 12:50.733
And I... [stammers]
I don't see how they're connected.

12:50.816 --> 12:52.234
It connects because...

12:53.068 --> 12:54.653
because, you know, we both won.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.118
- Do you think I should start from scratch?
- No. I mean...

13:02.953 --> 13:03.996
When's the deadline?

13:04.079 --> 13:05.915
It's tomorrow for early application.

13:05.998 --> 13:08.250
Can you come and help me tonight?

13:08.334 --> 13:10.628
We have our dinner tonight, remember?

13:10.711 --> 13:13.172
- Oh, my God!
- We already canceled last week.

13:14.340 --> 13:18.636
- You don't have to go. Just work on this.
- No, no, no. What's the point?

13:19.678 --> 13:21.972
- Hey, calm down.
- I'm calm. I'm calm.

13:22.056 --> 13:23.766
I'm just being honest. You know, I mean...

13:24.975 --> 13:27.394
- I'll end up working for my dad anyway.
- That's not true.

13:27.478 --> 13:29.271
I don't know, Nance.
Is that such a bad thing?

13:29.355 --> 13:33.067
There's insurance and benefits
and all that adult stuff.

13:35.319 --> 13:39.490
And if I took it, you know,
I could be around for your senior year.

13:39.573 --> 13:41.700
- Steve...
- Just to look after you a little bit.

13:41.784 --> 13:43.786
Make sure you don't forget
about this pretty face.

13:43.869 --> 13:45.246
[chuckles]

13:45.329 --> 13:46.747
Nance, I'm serious.

13:52.753 --> 13:55.172
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

13:55.256 --> 13:58.050

14:38.507 --> 14:40.676
I have no idea.

14:41.260 --> 14:43.137
But would you check out that ass?

14:43.846 --> 14:45.598
Just look at it go.

15:09.496 --> 15:11.206
Meet the human brain.

15:11.290 --> 15:13.626
I know. I know, it doesn't look like much.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.545
A little gross even, right?
But consider this.

15:16.629 --> 15:21.091
There are a hundred billion cells
inside of this miracle of evolution.

15:21.175 --> 15:22.593
All working as one.

15:22.676 --> 15:26.388
No, no, I did not misspeak.
I did not stutter.

15:26.472 --> 15:28.891
A hundred billion.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.144
- [door closes]
- Ah, this must be our new student.

15:32.227 --> 15:33.604
[principal] Indeed. All yours.

15:33.687 --> 15:36.148
All right. Hold up.
You don't get away that easy.

15:36.231 --> 15:37.775
Come on up. Don't be shy.

15:37.858 --> 15:39.902
Dustin, drum roll.

15:41.320 --> 15:45.115
Class, please welcome,
all the way from sunny California,

15:45.199 --> 15:50.120
the latest passenger to join us
on our curiosity voyage, Maxine.

15:50.746 --> 15:52.331
- It's Max.
- [Mr. Clarke] Sorry?

15:52.414 --> 15:55.042
Nobody calls me Maxine. It's Max.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.962
- [whispers] Mad Max.
- Well, all aboard, Max.

16:18.732 --> 16:20.234
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

16:20.317 --> 16:23.779
Do you have these in any other colors?
I'm not a big fan of orange.

16:23.862 --> 16:25.239
Hmm...

16:25.322 --> 16:26.532
I'll have to check in back.

16:33.664 --> 16:34.623
Oh, shit!

16:35.749 --> 16:38.127
- You're gonna get me fired.
- That's my master plan.

16:38.210 --> 16:40.838
Get you fired so I can hire you
and we won't have to hide back here.

16:42.881 --> 16:45.968
Bob? Bob, I have to get back to work.

16:46.051 --> 16:48.846
I know. I'm sorry.
I can't stop thinking about you.

16:48.929 --> 16:51.348
- It's crazy. I feel like a teenager.
- Me, too.

16:51.432 --> 16:53.934
You know, in high school,
you didn't know who I was.

16:54.018 --> 16:55.894
Come on. [chuckles]

16:55.978 --> 16:58.856
Bob, I have to get back to work.

16:58.939 --> 17:00.190
Okay.

17:00.274 --> 17:05.612
Go sell your electronic thingamajiggies,
and I'll see you tonight for movie night.

17:05.696 --> 17:06.947
Jonathan's night to pick?

17:07.031 --> 17:08.323
- Yes.
- Okay.

17:17.041 --> 17:20.335
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

17:20.961 --> 17:22.212
Hey, look, a green one.

17:23.589 --> 17:27.551
Tell Jonathan not to pick anything scary.
I hate scary movies.

17:45.277 --> 17:47.237
[Hopper] You're saying
this was fine yesterday?

17:47.321 --> 17:48.322
[Merrill] Fine?

17:48.405 --> 17:51.283
These were prize winners, Chief.
You should've seen 'em.

17:51.366 --> 17:53.744
For the life of me,
I couldn't figure out what happened.

17:53.827 --> 17:56.038
And then I remembered... Eugene.

17:57.247 --> 17:58.248
What about him?

17:58.332 --> 18:00.918
He's been complaining about me
to just about anyone who'll listen.

18:01.001 --> 18:02.669
Why's that?

18:02.753 --> 18:05.881
Well, he started this
"Pick Your Pumpkin" thing.

18:05.964 --> 18:07.508
Acted like it was trademarked.

18:07.591 --> 18:10.719
I said, "Hire yourself a damn lawyer.
See how far that gets you."

18:10.803 --> 18:13.764
You're telling me that nice old Eugene

18:14.223 --> 18:18.435
came out here after dark
and doused your field with poison?

18:18.519 --> 18:19.645
Not Eugene himself.

18:19.728 --> 18:22.689
- I'm thinking one of his field hands.
- Uh-huh.

18:22.773 --> 18:27.236
Listen, Chief, I don't go throwing around
accusations lightly. You know me.

18:27.319 --> 18:30.614
This happening the day before Halloween,
when sales are peaking?

18:30.697 --> 18:32.199
That's a hell of a coincidence.

18:32.282 --> 18:34.535
- Hell of a coincidence.
- [flies buzzing]

18:36.245 --> 18:38.080
You got somebody working on that field?

18:59.893 --> 19:00.894
[rustling]

19:07.317 --> 19:09.069
[rustling continues]

19:16.785 --> 19:18.579
- [screeching]
- [yells]

19:18.662 --> 19:20.622
- [panting]
- [caws]

19:23.041 --> 19:24.543
Yeah, screw you, too.

19:25.085 --> 19:28.422
[Tina] Hey. Be there.

19:30.132 --> 19:32.259
- Hey, Nancy.
- Hey! Thanks.

19:32.593 --> 19:34.720
- Oh, could I get one more?
- Yeah, sure.

19:37.848 --> 19:39.183
You're coming to this.

19:40.267 --> 19:42.102
"Come and get sheet faced."

19:43.270 --> 19:44.479
No, I'm not.

19:44.563 --> 19:49.318
I can't let you sit all alone Halloween.
That's just not acceptable.

19:49.401 --> 19:52.112
Well, you can relax.
I'm not gonna be alone.

19:52.905 --> 19:54.865
I'm going trick-or-treating with Will.

19:54.948 --> 19:56.742
- All night?
- Yeah.

19:57.659 --> 20:00.495
No, no way. You're gonna be home by 8:00,

20:01.205 --> 20:07.002
listening to the Talking Heads
and reading Vonnegut or something.

20:07.085 --> 20:08.629
Sounds like a nice night.

20:08.712 --> 20:13.091
Jonathan, just come. I mean, who knows,
you might even, like, meet someone.

20:13.175 --> 20:15.761
- [shrieks]
- [chuckles]

20:15.844 --> 20:20.057
- Oh, my God! Take those stupid things off.
- I missed you.

20:20.140 --> 20:22.476
- It's been like an hour.
- Tell me about it.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.107
Okay. Okay, okay. God.

20:30.525 --> 20:31.526
[Steve] Sorry.

20:40.035 --> 20:43.956
- [Mike] There's no way that's Mad Max.
- Yeah. Girls don't play video games.

20:44.039 --> 20:47.542
And even if they did,
you can't get 750,000 points on <i>Dig Dug. </i>

20:47.626 --> 20:49.795
- It's impossible.
- [Lucas] But her name is Max.

20:49.878 --> 20:52.673
- So what?
- So, how many Maxes do you know?

20:52.756 --> 20:54.967
- I don't know.
- [Lucas] Zero. That's how many.

20:55.050 --> 20:56.218
She shows up at school

20:56.301 --> 20:59.179
the day after someone with her same name
breaks our top score.

20:59.263 --> 21:03.141
- I mean, you kidding me?
- Exactly. So she's gotta be Mad Max.

21:03.225 --> 21:05.560
And plus she skateboards,
so she's pretty awesome.

21:05.644 --> 21:08.105
Awesome?
You haven't even spoken a word to her.

21:08.188 --> 21:12.192
I don't have to. I mean, look at her.
Shit, I've lost the target.

21:12.276 --> 21:13.819
Oh! There.

21:30.502 --> 21:32.504
Got it. There we go.

21:34.506 --> 21:37.676
[all] "Stop spying on me, creeps."

21:37.759 --> 21:38.969
Well, shit.

21:39.052 --> 21:40.095
[principal] William Byers.

21:41.388 --> 21:42.848
Your mother's here.

22:06.371 --> 22:08.081
[Dustin] You guys think he's okay?

22:08.165 --> 22:10.417
[Lucas] He's always weird
when he has to go in.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.170
I don't know. He's quiet today.

22:13.962 --> 22:15.172
He's always quiet.

22:34.316 --> 22:35.817
You feeling any better?

22:37.486 --> 22:38.320
Will?

22:38.403 --> 22:40.530
Huh? [mumbles]

22:40.614 --> 22:43.075
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

22:43.700 --> 22:47.537
Hey. What did we talk about, huh?
You've got to stop it with the sorries.

22:48.121 --> 22:52.292
Sorry. I mean, yeah, I know.

22:53.210 --> 22:58.048
And listen, you know, there's nothing
to be nervous about, you know.

22:58.131 --> 23:01.927
Just tell 'em what you felt last night
and what you saw.

23:02.511 --> 23:07.557
Hey, I'm gonna be there the whole time.
So it's gonna be okay. Okay?

23:09.643 --> 23:10.644
Okay.

23:30.455 --> 23:32.374
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

23:33.750 --> 23:34.835
Hey.

23:47.013 --> 23:48.598
[clatters]

24:15.292 --> 24:17.919
[whirring]

24:20.005 --> 24:22.048
Sir Will, how are you?

24:22.132 --> 24:23.842
Mom. Pop.

24:23.925 --> 24:26.553
Let's take a look,
see what's going on here.

24:26.636 --> 24:30.182
I see you shaved off a pound
since we saw you last.

24:30.265 --> 24:33.018
Must be making room
for all that Halloween candy.

24:33.101 --> 24:34.227
What's your favorite candy?

24:34.311 --> 24:36.855
Desert island candy,
if you had to pick one?

24:36.938 --> 24:38.398
- I don't know.
- Come on.

24:38.481 --> 24:40.400
Life or death situation,
what would you pick?

24:40.483 --> 24:42.986
- I guess... Reese's Pieces.
- [mouthing] Reese's Pieces.

24:43.069 --> 24:45.822
Good call. Good call.

24:45.906 --> 24:47.199
I'm more of a Mounds guy,

24:47.282 --> 24:51.495
but I gotta say, peanut butter
and chocolate, come on, hard to beat that.

24:51.578 --> 24:53.413
<i>All right, tell me</i>
<i>what's going on with you.</i>

24:53.496 --> 24:55.165
<i>Tell me about this episode you had.</i>

24:56.750 --> 25:01.671
[Will] <i>Well, my friends were there</i>
<i>and then they just weren't,</i>

25:01.755 --> 25:03.423
<i>and I was back there again.</i>

25:04.049 --> 25:05.300
In the Upside Down?

25:06.676 --> 25:08.428
All right, so what happened next?

25:08.511 --> 25:15.018
I heard this noise, and so I went outside,
and it was worse.

25:15.101 --> 25:16.353
How was it worse?

25:17.020 --> 25:18.313
There was this storm.

25:18.396 --> 25:19.481
[thunder crashing]

25:22.275 --> 25:25.028
Okay. So how did you feel
when you saw the storm?

25:25.111 --> 25:26.112
I felt...

25:27.155 --> 25:28.031
frozen.

25:31.493 --> 25:34.329
- Heart racing?
- Just frozen.

25:34.412 --> 25:37.415
Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch?

25:37.499 --> 25:40.502
No. Like how you feel when you're scared,

25:40.585 --> 25:44.965
and you can't breathe or talk
or do anything.

25:45.048 --> 25:49.052
I felt... felt this evil,
like it was looking at me.

25:50.762 --> 25:52.806
It was evil?

25:52.889 --> 25:56.101
Well... [clears throat]
What do you think the evil wanted?

25:56.184 --> 25:57.435
To kill.

25:57.519 --> 25:59.229
[whirring rapidly]

25:59.312 --> 26:00.814
To kill you?

26:01.439 --> 26:02.440
Not me.

26:05.026 --> 26:06.319
Everyone else.

26:19.457 --> 26:21.376
[Owens] All right,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

26:21.459 --> 26:24.379
It's probably gonna get worse
before it gets better.

26:24.462 --> 26:28.174
Worse? He's already had
two episodes this month.

26:28.258 --> 26:30.802
He'll likely have more
before the month is out.

26:30.885 --> 26:34.597
It's called the Anniversary Effect.
And we've seen this with soldiers.

26:34.681 --> 26:38.101
The anniversary of an event brings back
traumatic memories.

26:38.184 --> 26:40.645
Sort of opens up
the neurological floodgates, so to speak.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.355
So what does this mean for the kid?

26:42.439 --> 26:44.316
He's gonna have more episodes, nightmares?

26:44.399 --> 26:47.319
Yeah, that.
Maybe some personality changes.

26:47.402 --> 26:50.071
He might get irritable. He might lash out.

26:50.155 --> 26:51.573
What do we do when that happens?

26:51.656 --> 26:56.036
Okay. Well, from what we know
about post-traumatic stress...

26:56.119 --> 26:59.914
And we're still learning, okay?
Just treat him normally.

26:59.998 --> 27:03.501
Be patient with him.
Don't pressure him to talk.

27:03.585 --> 27:05.003
Just let him lead the way.

27:05.086 --> 27:08.298
I'm sorry, what you're saying
is it's gonna get worse and worse

27:08.381 --> 27:10.592
and we're just supposed to pretend
it's not happening?

27:10.675 --> 27:12.344
It sounds counterintuitive, I know.

27:12.427 --> 27:15.805
But I assure you that is really
the best thing you can do for him.

27:19.893 --> 27:23.605
Listen. I understand what you went through
last year. I get it.

27:23.688 --> 27:27.317
But those people are gone.
They're gone. Okay?

27:27.942 --> 27:29.527
So if we're gonna get through this,

27:30.403 --> 27:33.823
I just... I need you to realize
I'm on your side.

27:36.242 --> 27:37.619
I need you to trust me.

27:40.372 --> 27:41.247
[Joyce] <i>"Trust me"?</i>

27:41.331 --> 27:43.333
- Are you kidding me?
- [Hopper] Yeah, I know.

27:43.416 --> 27:47.170
But, you know, university gives out
a degree, this guy's got it.

27:47.253 --> 27:51.257
And look, that post-traumatic stuff
he's talking about, that stuff is real.

27:52.717 --> 27:54.844
He's gonna be okay. All right?

27:56.304 --> 27:58.139
How's Bob the Brain?

27:58.973 --> 28:00.308
Don't call him that.

28:00.392 --> 28:01.893
Sorry. Old habit.

28:02.519 --> 28:04.521
He's good. We're good.

28:04.604 --> 28:06.689
Good. I'm happy for you.

28:06.773 --> 28:08.858
Really. Hey...

28:09.526 --> 28:11.861
Things get worse, you call me first.

28:13.446 --> 28:14.447
You call me.

28:15.073 --> 28:16.074
Okay.

28:38.930 --> 28:40.181
They're ready for you, sir.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.198
- Patty.
- Sam.

28:58.658 --> 28:59.617
Afternoon, sir.

28:59.701 --> 29:03.079
- Looks like another hot one today, huh?
- Never gets old, sir.

29:39.616 --> 29:42.744
[screeching]

29:50.460 --> 29:52.045
[Dustin] Still no sign?

29:52.128 --> 29:53.171
[Lucas] Jack shit.

29:53.254 --> 29:58.384
- Oh! Damn it. My mom's gonna murder me.
- So go home. I'll radio if she comes.

29:58.468 --> 30:01.679
Oh, yeah, nice try. You just want me
out of here so you can make your move.

30:01.763 --> 30:03.681
- Oh, 'cause you're such a threat.
- That's right.

30:03.765 --> 30:06.226
She will not be able to resist
these pearls.

- What?

30:16.569 --> 30:18.696
[indistinct arguing]

30:18.780 --> 30:20.657
- They're arguing. They're arguing.
- Oh, my God.

30:20.740 --> 30:23.034
I see that. I don't even know
why you need those.

30:23.117 --> 30:24.494
God. You're so stupid.

30:31.876 --> 30:34.420
[video game chiming]

30:41.261 --> 30:42.428
She's incredible.

30:44.514 --> 30:45.515
She's...

30:46.349 --> 30:47.684
[both] Mad Max.

30:51.896 --> 30:55.316
After dinner, I want you to pick out
your toys for the yard sale.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.151
- Fine.
- Two boxes' worth.

30:57.235 --> 30:59.028
- Two boxes?
- You heard me.

30:59.112 --> 31:00.905
I'm fine with you giving away a couple,

31:00.989 --> 31:03.074
but the other ones have
way too much emotional value.

31:03.157 --> 31:05.743
- Emotional value?
- They're hunks of plastic, Michael.

31:05.827 --> 31:07.078
You already took away my Atari.

31:07.161 --> 31:09.706
Didn't wanna lose more toys,
you shouldn't have stolen from Nancy.

31:09.789 --> 31:11.249
I didn't steal. I borrowed.

31:11.332 --> 31:13.918
Oh, and you didn't curse out Mr. Kowalski
last week either, right?

31:14.002 --> 31:16.546
Or plagiarize that essay?
Or graffiti the bathroom stall?

31:16.629 --> 31:18.339
Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall.

31:18.423 --> 31:22.010
So if your friend jumps off a cliff,
you're gonna jump, too?

31:22.093 --> 31:25.889
We know you've had a hard year, Michael.
But we've been patient.

31:25.972 --> 31:28.683
This isn't strike one.
This isn't even strike three.

31:28.766 --> 31:31.311
It's strike 20. You're on the bench, son.

31:31.394 --> 31:35.148
And if it'd been my coach,
you'd be lucky to still be on the team.

31:35.231 --> 31:38.318
Two boxes. Two.

31:45.450 --> 31:47.368
[Steve] <i>Okay. Ready?</i>

31:48.286 --> 31:49.412
Yeah.

31:50.663 --> 31:52.206
[sighs] Okay.

31:52.957 --> 31:54.417
[doorbell rings]

31:58.630 --> 32:00.673
[Marsha] I'm so sorry
I didn't get to cook.

32:00.757 --> 32:03.676
I was gonna make that baked ziti
you guys like so much,

32:03.760 --> 32:06.054
but I just forgot about the time,
and before you know it,

32:06.137 --> 32:07.722
"Oh, my God, it's five o'clock."

32:07.805 --> 32:10.767
- It's fine. It's great.
- Right. I love KFC.

32:12.393 --> 32:16.606
So, I noticed a "For Sale" sign
out in your yard.

32:16.689 --> 32:19.233
Is that the neighbors', or...

32:19.317 --> 32:21.819
- You wanna tell them?
- Go ahead.

32:24.238 --> 32:27.951
We hired a man named Murray Bauman.
Have either of you heard of him?

32:29.160 --> 32:31.204
- No.
- No, I don't think so.

32:31.287 --> 32:34.832
He was an investigative journalist
for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times.</i>

32:34.916 --> 32:36.209
He's pretty well known.

32:36.292 --> 32:40.838
Anyway, he's freelance now,
and he agreed to take the case.

32:41.464 --> 32:43.883
That's... That's great.

32:44.676 --> 32:46.886
No, that's really... That's great, right?

32:46.970 --> 32:50.431
Um, what exactly does that mean?

32:50.515 --> 32:53.476
Means he's gonna do
what that lazy son of a bitch Jim Hop--

32:55.812 --> 32:56.813
Sorry.

32:57.897 --> 32:58.940
[exhales]

32:59.023 --> 33:01.526
What the Hawkins police haven't been
capable of doing.

33:02.318 --> 33:05.488
Means we have a real detective
on the case.

33:05.571 --> 33:06.572
It means...

33:07.782 --> 33:09.450
we're going to find our Barb.

33:10.076 --> 33:13.121
If anyone can find her, it's this man.

33:14.163 --> 33:18.626
He already has leads.
By God, he's worth every last penny.

33:19.627 --> 33:21.963
Is that why you're selling the house?

33:22.046 --> 33:24.465
Don't worry about us, sweetie. We're fine.

33:25.216 --> 33:26.342
More than fine.

33:26.426 --> 33:30.263
For the first time in a long time,
we're hopeful.

33:33.683 --> 33:36.352
[stammers] Excuse me. I'll be right back.

33:46.654 --> 33:49.032

35:22.542 --> 35:24.877
It's me. It's Mike.

35:25.628 --> 35:29.632
It's day 352, 7:40 p.m.

35:31.217 --> 35:32.218
I'm still here.

35:36.764 --> 35:39.642
If you're out there, say something.
Or give me a sign.

35:39.725 --> 35:43.479
I won't even say anything.
Just... I wanna know if you're okay.

35:44.272 --> 35:45.857

<i>Yeah, it's me, Dustin.</i>
<i>What're you doing on this channel again?</i>

36:01.289 --> 36:04.709
I've been trying to reach you all day.
We were right. Max is Mad Max.

- Yeah, I'm busy.
<i>- But--</i>

- [Lucas] What do we do now?
- We stick to the plan.

36:10.882 --> 36:11.883
Mike's not gonna like it.

36:11.966 --> 36:14.093
Last time I checked,
our party is not a dictatorship.

36:14.177 --> 36:16.220
- It's a democracy.
- What if Max says no?

36:16.304 --> 36:19.098
How can Max say no to these? [purrs]

36:19.182 --> 36:20.725
I told you to stop that.

36:20.808 --> 36:22.435
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Later.

36:35.990 --> 36:37.366

- Stop. Stop!
- [Bob] What?

37:06.771 --> 37:09.065
Come on, you gotta get used to it.
This is the future.

37:09.148 --> 37:11.150
Well, put the future down
and get me a clean bowl.

37:15.404 --> 37:16.614
[knocking on door]

37:18.032 --> 37:22.578
Hey, bud. I didn't know
what you'd like, so I got a variety.

37:23.329 --> 37:25.665
- Take your pick.
- Whatever you want.

37:26.916 --> 37:27.792
All right.

37:30.211 --> 37:31.545
What are you working on?

37:33.047 --> 37:36.133
Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy?

37:37.760 --> 37:40.513
- Me.
- Did someone call you that?

37:41.722 --> 37:45.768
Hey. You can talk to me.
You know that, right?

37:45.851 --> 37:48.604
Whatever happened.
Will, come on, talk to me.

37:48.688 --> 37:50.648
- Stop treating me like that.
- What? Like what?

37:50.731 --> 37:53.109
Like everyone else.
Like there's something wrong with me.

37:53.192 --> 37:54.944
What are you talking about?

37:55.027 --> 37:57.280
Mom, Dustin, Lucas. Everyone.

37:57.363 --> 37:59.407
They all treat me like I'm gonna break.

37:59.490 --> 38:02.076
Like I'm a baby.
Like I can't handle things on my own.

38:03.202 --> 38:06.414
It doesn't help. It just makes me feel
like more of a freak.

38:06.497 --> 38:09.667
- You're not a freak.
- Yeah, I am.

38:10.584 --> 38:11.585
I am.

38:14.922 --> 38:17.591
You know what? You're right.

38:19.218 --> 38:20.511
You are a freak.

38:21.595 --> 38:23.806
- What?
- No, I'm serious. You're a freak.

38:23.889 --> 38:28.519
But what? Do you wanna be normal?
Do you wanna be just like everyone else?

38:28.602 --> 38:30.730
Being a freak is the best. I'm a freak.

38:30.813 --> 38:33.024
Is that why you don't have any friends?

38:33.649 --> 38:36.235
[chuckles] I have friends, Will.

38:36.319 --> 38:38.446
Then why are you
always hanging out with me?

38:39.739 --> 38:42.116
Because you're my best friend, all right?

38:42.199 --> 38:46.287
And I would rather be best friends
with Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody.

38:46.370 --> 38:47.705
You know what I mean?

38:48.414 --> 38:49.915
Okay, look...

38:50.833 --> 38:54.420
Who would you rather be friends with?
Bowie or Kenny Rogers?

38:54.503 --> 38:55.713
Ugh.

38:55.796 --> 38:57.965
Exactly. It's no contest.

38:58.674 --> 39:01.218
The thing is, nobody normal

39:01.302 --> 39:03.763
ever accomplished anything meaningful
in this world.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.432
- You got it?
- Well...

39:07.308 --> 39:10.019
- some people like Kenny Rogers.
- Kenny Rogers.

39:10.102 --> 39:12.730
I love Kenny Rogers. [chuckles]

39:13.522 --> 39:15.316
